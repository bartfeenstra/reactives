**Reactives** lets you write reactive code easily by making any of your objects and functions *reactive*. A reactive
can be *triggered* (`reactive.react.trigger()`), causing all its *reactors* to be called. A *reactor* is any callable
that takes no arguments, and you add it to a reactive via `reactive.react(reactor)`. When a reactive is triggered,
its reactors and its reactors' reactors are resolved, and each is called once in order.

**Reactives** uses a push-pull approach, meaning change notifications are pushed (reactors are called automatically and
won't have to pull for changes), but if a reactor needs to know what exactly changed, it must pull this information
itself.

## Usage
For any type to be reactive, it must have a `react` attribute containing a `reactives.ReactorController`. The most
common way to achieve this, is to decorate that type with `@reactives.reactive`. Some classes are provided that are
reactive and can be instantiated or inherited from directly.

### Custom classes
Decorate a class to make its individual instances reactive:
```python
import reactive from reactives

@reactive
class Apple:
    pass

apple = Apple()
apple.react(lambda: print('The apple got triggered!'))
apple.react.trigger()
# >>> "The apple got triggered!"
```

### Functions and methods 
Decorate a function:
```python
import reactive from reactives

@reactive
def apple():
    pass

apple.react(lambda: print('The apple got triggered!'))
apple.react.trigger()
# >>> "The apple got triggered!"
```

Decorate a method on a **reactive class**:
```python
import reactive from reactives

@reactive
class Apple:
    @reactive
    def apple(self):
        pass

apple = Apple()
apple.react.getattr('apple').react(lambda: print('The apple got triggered!'))
apple.react.getattr('apple').react.trigger()
# >>> "The apple got triggered!"
```
Reactive methods must be accessed through their instance, because `Apple.apple` would yield the class method.

Both functions and methods can be called automatically when they're triggered. This lets them set up something once, and
update that thing when they're triggered:
```python
import reactive from reactives

@reactive(on_trigger_call=True)
def warm_caches():
    """
    Warm the application's caches. When triggered (because the cached data has changed), re-warm the caches.
    """
    pass
```

### Properties
Decorate a property:
```python
import reactive from reactives

@reactive
class Apple:
    @reactive
    @property
    def apple(self) -> str:
        return 'I got you something!'

apple = Apple()
apple.react.getattr('apple').react(lambda: print('The apple got triggered!'))
apple.react.getattr('apple').react.trigger()
# >>> "The apple got triggered!"
```

Properties can call any callable automatically when they're triggered. This can be useful for computed properties. The
callable receives the property's instance as its only argument:
```python
import reactive from reactives

@reactive
class Apple:
    def __init__(self):
        self._computed_something = None
        
    @reactive(on_trigger=(lambda instance: setattr(instance, '_computed_something', None),))
    @property
    def apple(self) -> str:
        if self._computed_something is None:
            self._computed_something = 'I got you something!'
        return self._computed_something
```

Optionally add a setter and/or deleter like you would to any non-reactive property. If either the setter or deleter is
called, the property will be triggered.
```python
import reactive from reactives

@reactive
class Apple:
    def __init__(self):
        self._something = 'I got you something!'
        
    @reactive
    @property
    def apple(self) -> str:
        return self._something
    
    @apple.setter
    def apple(self, something: str):
        self._something = something
    
    @apple.deleter
    def apple(self):
        self._something = None

apple = Apple()
apple.react.getattr('apple').react(lambda: print('The apple got triggered!'))
apple.apple = 'I got you something else!'
# >>> "The apple got triggered!"
del apple.apple
# >>> "The apple got triggered!"
```

Values set through a property may themselves be reactive too. If they are, the property and the value are autowired, 
which means that the property becomes a reactor to the newly added value. As soon as the value is triggered,
so is the property. Therefore, if you want to react to any change to any of the values a property might have, all you
need to do is add your reactor to the property.

### Lists
`ReactiveList` is a reactive version of Python's built-in `list`. You can use it in exactly the same way as `list`:
```python
from reactives import ReactiveList

fruits = ReactiveList(['apple', 'banana'])
fruits.react(lambda: print('Look at all these delicious fruits!'))
fruits.append('orange')
# >>> "Look at all these delicious fruits!"
```

Values added to a `ReactiveList` may themselves be reactive too. If they are, the list and the value are autowired, 
which means that the list becomes a reactor to the newly added value. As soon as the value is triggered,
so is the list. Therefore, if you want to react to any change to any of the values in a `ReactiveList`, all you
need to do is add your reactor to the list.

### Dictionaries
`ReactiveDict` is a reactive version of Python's built-in `dict`. You can use it in exactly the same way as `dict`:
```python
from reactives import ReactiveDict

fruits = ReactiveDict(apple=5, banana=2)
fruits.react(lambda: print('Look at all these delicious fruits!'))
fruits['orange'] = 4
# >>> "Look at all these delicious fruits!"
```

Values added to a `ReactiveDict` may themselves be reactive too. If they are, the dictionary and the value are
autowired, which means that the dictionary becomes a reactor to the newly added value. As soon as the value is
triggered, so is the dictionary. Therefore, if you want to react to any change to any of the values in a `ReactiveDict`, 
all you  need to do is add your reactor to the dictionary.

### Autowiring
We've seen how [properties](#Properties), [lists](#Lists), and [dictionaries](#Dictionaries) autowire themselves to
their values. This is possible because properties, lists, and dictionaries know exactly which values move in and out of
them. In other cases, we use *scope*. Any reactive can start a scope with `reactives.Scope.collect()` and collect all
reactives that are called or used during that scope window, and autowire itself to them. Conversely, any reactive can
register itself with the current scope (if there is one) with `reactives.Scope.register*()`, and allow reactives
depending on it to autowire themselves. In fact, this is what properties do internally.

Autowiring means that as a developer, you won't need to worry about connecting the parts of your application most of the
time.

## Development
First, [fork and clone](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) the repository, and navigate to its root directory.

### Requirements
- Bash (you're all good if `which bash` outputs a path in your terminal)

### Installation
If you have [tox](https://pypi.org/project/tox/) installed on your machine, `tox --develop` will create the necessary
virtual environments and install all development dependencies. 

Alternatively, in any existing Python environment, run `./bin/build-dev`.

### Testing
In any existing Python environment, run `./bin/test`.

### Fixing problems automatically
In any existing Python environment, run `./bin/fix`.
